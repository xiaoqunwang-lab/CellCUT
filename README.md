# CellCUT
CellCUT is a computational framework for cell segmentation and transcript assignment in case with spatial transcriptomic data.

## Introduction
CellCUT introduces the concept of consensus optimization, which combines the composition signals acquired from transcripts and 
nuclear information derived from staining images to obtain cell borders, with the assumption that nuclear and gene transcripts in the same cell are spatially similar. 

## How to use
